# Mathematics of Autonomous Agency in AAOS

While autonomy is ultimately *executed* in code, it is *grounded* in formal mathematics.  This document collects the principal mathematical frameworks that inform the AAOS design.

---

## 1. Object-Oriented Reinforcement Learning (OORL)

AAOS implements **OORL** as described in `oorl_framework.ex`.  Formally:

• **World** – A tuple  \(\mathcal{W} = (\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{R}, T)\) where:
  - \(\mathcal{O}\) is a set of *objects* (agents, sensors, …).
  - \(\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{O} \times \mathcal{O}\) is the set of *relations* (edges in the interaction graph).
  - \(T\) is a global transition function composed from local transitions \(T_i\).

• **Local Dynamics** – Each object *i* is modelled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP):

\[
\langle \mathcal{S}_i, \mathcal{A}_i, \mathcal{O}_i, T_i, R_i, \gamma \rangle
\]

where \(T_i\) and \(R_i\) may depend on messages from neighbours.  This factorisation permits \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) rather than \(\mathcal{O}(2^n)\) complexity for *n* objects under sparse interactions.


## 2. Graph-Theoretic Foundations

The runtime forms a dynamic directed multigraph \(G_t = (V_t, E_t)\) where:

• \(V_t\) – set of living objects at time *t*  
• \(E_t\) – set of messages or contracts with attributes (latency, TTL, trust)

Algorithms implemented in `object_coordination_service.ex` exploit:

• **Centrality metrics** for emergent leadership (betweenness, eigenvector).  
• **Graph partitioning** to contain failures during network splits.


## 3. Exploration Bonus Formulation

From `object_exploration.ex`, the generic hybrid bonus is

\[
b(s,a) = \beta_N \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{N(s)}} + \beta_U \cdot \sigma_{\theta}(s,a) + \beta_C \cdot IG(s,a) + \beta_S \cdot SN(s)\ ,
\]

where

• \(N(s)\) – state visitation count (novelty)  
• \(\sigma_{\theta}(s,a)\) – predictive uncertainty of value network  
• \(IG\) – information gain estimate  
• \(SN\) – social-novelty score from interaction dyads  
• \(\beta_∗\) – weights set in `exploration_parameters`.


## 4. Policy Gradient with Shared Baseline

`Object.TransferLearning` implements a federated variant of Advantage Actor-Critic:

\[
\nabla_\theta J \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t} \nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t^i \mid s_t^i) \left( r_t^i + \gamma V_{ϕ}(s_{t+1}^i) - V_{ϕ}(s_t^i) \right)
\]

Where the critic parameters \(ϕ\) are aggregated across objects using a *FedAvg* consensus step.


## 5. Schema Evolution as Category Theory

State schemas are objects in a category \(\mathsf{Schema}\).  A migration is a morphism \(f: S \to S'\).  Composition of migrations obeys associativity, enabling **version calculus**:

\[
S \xrightarrow{f} S' \xrightarrow{g} S'' = S \xrightarrow{g \circ f} S''
\]

This abstraction justifies the hot-swap upgrade mechanism where multiple incremental migrations are collapsed into a single compound transformation before run-time execution.


## 6. Trust & Reputation Model

`Object.TrustManager` updates reputation scores via Bayesian inference:

\[
P(T \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid T) P(T)}{P(E)}\ ,
\qquad
T∈\{\text{trustworthy}, \text{untrustworthy}\}
\]

Events (successful transactions, SLA violations, malicious messages) adjust priors; the posterior modulates message acceptance probability.


## 7. Stability & Convergence Guarantees

Under assumptions of bounded delays and stochastic policies with entropy regularisation, the learning process is a contraction mapping in expected value space, ensuring almost-sure convergence (see tests `learning_convergence_stability_test.exs`).


## 8. Complexity Snapshot

| Component | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Local value update | \(\mathcal{O}(|A|)\) | \(\mathcal{O}(|S|)\) |
| Message routing (GenStage partition) | \(\mathcal{O}(\log N)\) | \(\mathcal{O}(N)\) |
| Coalition formation | \(\mathcal{O}(k^2)\) for *k* candidates | \(\mathcal{O}(k)\) |


## 9. Open Mathematical Questions

1. Formal proof of global stability under simultaneous schema evolution and policy updates.
2. Optimal exploration-exploitation trade-off in high-dimensional social state spaces.
3. Game-theoretic analysis of trust dynamics with adversarial agents.


## 10. Summary

By grounding autonomy in **MDPs**, **graph theory**, **information theory**, **category theory** and **Bayesian inference**, AAOS marries rigorous mathematical foundations with pragmatic engineering, yielding agents that are both theoretically sound and empirically effective.
